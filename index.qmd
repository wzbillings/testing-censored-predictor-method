title: "Testing the correction for censored predictors"
---

While working on the norovirus project, we needed to fit models where the
outcome is binary but there is a predictor which is real-valued and has a limit
of detection. According to [Tran et al 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.8995), the ML
model is then given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell &= \sum_{\text{uncensored data}} \log \left( f_{Y\mid X=x}(Y \mid X = x) \right) \quad +\\
& \sum_{x \text{ censored}}\log\left( \frac{1}{F_X(x)} \right).
\end{aligned}
$$

We can omit the other cases since $y$ is not censored here (it is binary and
therefore cannot be censored).
