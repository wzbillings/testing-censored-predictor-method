title: "A comparison of methods for regression with a censored covariate"
---

Lab assays often produce censored data, and these censored data are often used
as both the dependent and independent variables in regression models. Most
often, the censored nature of the data is completely ignored and censored values
are treated as known constants. While adjustments for censored outcomes are
straightforward, methods for proper handling of censored covariates (a term we
use exchangeably with independent variable or predictor) are virtually unknown
in the lab sciences, and there is no clear consensus on the correct approach in
the literature.
